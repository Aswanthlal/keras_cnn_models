# CNN Projects
## This repo contains three small CNN-based projects demonstrating:

* Basic CNN on MNIST – A simple digit classifier using Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense layers.

* Dropout + Adadelta Optimizer (MNIST) – Same dataset, with added dropout layers and optimizer tuning.

* Pre-trained ResNet50 (ImageNet) – Feature extraction and prediction using ResNet50 on real images.

These examples cover training from scratch, regularization, and transfer learning
